# Kilangi Jewellery Website

eCommerce homepage for a premium jewelry brand. Built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## What's Inside

Just a clean, responsive homepage with some nice interactions. No frameworks or libraries needed - kept it simple with plain HTML/CSS/JS.

### Features

- Smooth animations and transitions
- Interactive product cards with hover effects
- Mobile-friendly navigation
- Category filtering tabs
- Testimonials section
- Gift finder sections
- And more...

### Design

Colors match the provided design:
- Dark green: `#0A3D3D`
- Cream background: `#F8F4EF`
- Gold accents: `#D4AF37`

Using Playfair Display for headings and Inter for body text.

## Interactions I Added

Since the design didn't show hover states or animations, I added these:

**Product Cards:**
- Hover to see wishlist button
- Click heart to add to wishlist (with animation)
- Ripple effect when clicking cards
- Image zooms on hover

**Navigation:**
- Sticky header that follows you
- Smooth mobile menu
- Search bar with clear button

**Other Cool Stuff:**
- 3D tilt effect on gift cards
- Parallax on hero image
- Prices count up when scrolling into view
- Floating icons
- Auto-rotating testimonials on mobile
- Easter egg: click the logo 5 times for confetti 🎉

## How to Use

Just open `index.html` in your browser. That's it.

```bash
# Double click index.html
# or
start index.html
```

## Files

```
├── index.html    # Main page
├── styles.css    # All the styles
├── script.js     # Interactions
└── README.md     # This file
```

## Responsive Breakpoints

- Mobile: < 768px
- Tablet: 768px - 968px

## Notes

- Images are from Unsplash (just placeholders, replace with real product photos)
- All interactions are vanilla JS - no jQuery or other libraries
- Tested in Chrome, should work fine in other modern browsers
- Some features like the confetti are just for fun :)
